# DSA-Sliding-window
📅 Day 26 of hashtag#365DaysOfDSA
Today I solved two interesting LeetCode problems that strengthened my understanding of pattern-based problem solving:
🔹 3190. Find Minimum Operations to Make All Elements Divisible by Three – A simple modulus-based logic to count operations efficiently.
🔹 713. Subarray Product Less Than K – Applied sliding window with dynamic shrinking to maintain valid product ranges.


📅 Day 27 of #365DaysOfDSA  Today I solved LeetCode 930: Binary Subarrays With Sum — a powerful application of Prefix Sum + HashMap to count subarrays efficiently.  🔹 Learned how prefix differences help identify subarrays matching the target sum 🔹 Used map.getOrDefault() to handle frequency updates cleanly

Today I solved LeetCode 1018 — Binary Prefix Divisible By 5, a problem that helped me understand how binary prefixes can be processed efficiently using mathematics instead of converting entire numbers.
🔍 What I learned
Instead of forming full binary numbers, we can track prefixes using modular arithmetic.
Key insight:
prefix = (prefix * 2 + currentBit) % 5;

Solved 1015. Smallest Integer Divisible by K today.
 Used modular arithmetic to track remainders and avoid overflow while building numbers made only of 1s.
 Simple logic, clean solution! 💡
🚀 On to Day 30!
