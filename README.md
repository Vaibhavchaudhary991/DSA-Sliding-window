# DSA-Sliding-window
📅 Day 26 of hashtag#365DaysOfDSA
Today I solved two interesting LeetCode problems that strengthened my understanding of pattern-based problem solving:
🔹 3190. Find Minimum Operations to Make All Elements Divisible by Three – A simple modulus-based logic to count operations efficiently.
🔹 713. Subarray Product Less Than K – Applied sliding window with dynamic shrinking to maintain valid product ranges.


📅 Day 27 of #365DaysOfDSA  Today I solved LeetCode 930: Binary Subarrays With Sum — a powerful application of Prefix Sum + HashMap to count subarrays efficiently.  🔹 Learned how prefix differences help identify subarrays matching the target sum 🔹 Used map.getOrDefault() to handle frequency updates cleanly 

📅 Day 28 of #365DaysOfDSA
Today I solved LeetCode 1018 — Binary Prefix Divisible By 5, a problem that helped me understand how binary prefixes can be processed efficiently using mathematics instead of converting entire numbers.
🔍 What I learned
Instead of forming full binary numbers, we can track prefixes using modular arithmetic.
Key insight:
prefix = (prefix * 2 + currentBit) % 5;

📅 Day 29 of hashtag#365DaysOfDSA
Solved 1015. Smallest Integer Divisible by K today.
 Used modular arithmetic to track remainders and avoid overflow while building numbers made only of 1s.
 Simple logic, clean solution! 💡
🚀 On to Day 30!

📅 Day 30 of #365DaysOfDSA
Today I solved three prefix-sum-based problems:
🔹 1248. Count Number of Nice Subarrays
Used prefix sum + hashmap to efficiently count subarrays with exactly k odd numbers.
🔹 724. Find Pivot Index
Applied running prefix sums to balance left and right subarray sums.
🔹 2574. Left and Right Sum Differences
Computed prefix and suffix sums to calculate differences for each index in linear time.

🚀 Day 31 of #365DaysOfDSA
Today I tackled two important sliding window + prefix sum problems:
🔹 LeetCode 523 – Continuous Subarray Sum
Learned how modulo + hashmap can efficiently detect subarrays whose sum is divisible by k.
🔹 LeetCode 209 – Minimum Size Subarray Sum
Used the two-pointer/sliding window pattern to find the smallest subarray with sum ≥ target — great for mastering window optimization.
